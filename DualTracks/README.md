# DWFiv3's Dual Tracks
https://github.com/DWFiv3/RailRoader/tree/main/DualTracks

Provides a FULL dual track from Sylva to Andrews

**This mode is a work in progress IT IS NOT FINISHED.**

**KEEP LEFT**
- Run your trains on the left track, not the right

**Some signals just don't work**, they have been disabled

Switches need to be set, this is **IMPORTANT** as you will end up in different places and going into the wrong side of things.
- Set tracks to keep on the lefthand track unless you have a need to. In my game I keep the Passanger trains running in a constant loop

# Things to note
- Ela Passanger track only works on the inner track (towards whittier), coming the other way you dont stop
- Wilmot station is the same (whittier bound)
