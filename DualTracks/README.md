### DWFiv3's Dual Tracks ###

Provides a FULL dual track from Sylva to Andrews

**This mode is a work in progress IT IS NOT FINISHED.**

**KEEP LEFT**
- Run your trains on the left track, not the right

Some signals just don't work, they have been disabled

Switches need to be set, this is **IMPORTANT** as you will end up in different places and going into the wrong side of things.
